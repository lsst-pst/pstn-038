A description of the Prompt Processing Performance with respect to
ComCam and LSSTCam observations including sustained observing periods
and science validation surveys. This should include the completeness
of alert generation, the fraction of false positives, the performance
of machine learning for false positive classification, the photometric
accuracy of the time series data, how the performace degrades as a
function of system parameters and observing conditions (focal plane
position, airmass, seeing, transparency, source color). Examples of
alerts detected in the commissioning period.
